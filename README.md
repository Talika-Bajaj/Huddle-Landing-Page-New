## Hi! ðŸ‘‹

This is my 24th Frontend Mentor Coding Challenge.

Completed a challenge from Frontend Mentor using HTML and CSS, which significantly enhanced my layout skills. This challenge boosted my confidence in creating websites with meticulous attention to detail, allowing me to produce visually appealing and functionally similar projects. The hands-on practice was invaluable in refining my web development capabilities.



**Had fun building!** ðŸš€
